 * like a continuation; older callbacks render as a regular post with a Twitter-style
 * quote pointing back to the original — which itself stays in the feed where it lives,
 * NOT consumed by the reply. The user reaches the original by tapping the quote.
 *
 * Two signals must both fire to thread:
 *   1. **Consecutive** — no other post of the same channel sits between the reply and the
 *      parent in the visible feed. A channel that posts unrelated B in the middle, then
 *      replies to old A, is doing a callback, not extending a thread.
 *   2. **Fresh** — `reply.date - parent.date ≤ THREAD_FRESH_WINDOW_MS` (1 h). Two-week-old
 *      parents thread with their replies looks like archaeology, not conversation.
 *
 * Cross-channel replies (parent in another channel) intentionally never thread — that's
 * a quote relationship, semantically a citation. They render as Single with the quote
 * preview pointing at the parent post.
 *
 * The feed is ordered newest-first; reply iterates BEFORE its parent. When threading
 * fires we consume both keys so the parent's later iteration is a no-op skip. When we
 * decide NOT to thread we leave the parent unconsumed — it shows as its own Single later,
 * unchanged, exactly where its date placed it.
 *
 * Long chains (A ← B ← C, all fresh & consecutive): iteration hits C first, consumes B as
 * its parent → Thread(B, C). A is then iterated and emitted as Single. B's inline quote
 * preview of A still renders inside the threaded slot (parent in a thread keeps its own
 * inline reply), giving a natural three-step visual without a triple-card stack.
