## [Unreleased]

### Added
- English localization. All user-facing strings extracted to `res/values/strings.xml`
  (English, default fallback) and `res/values-uk/strings.xml` (Ukrainian). Android
  picks the locale automatically from system settings; non-Ukrainian devices now see
  English. TDLib's `systemLanguageCode` follows `Locale.getDefault().language` so
  server-localized payloads (country picker, error messages where applicable) match
  the active app locale instead of always being Ukrainian.
- `<plurals>` resources for grammatically correct count formatting — `new_posts`
  (1 / 2-4 / 11-14 forms in Ukrainian, one/other in English), `service_boost` and
  the `duration_minutes` / `duration_hours` flood-wait helpers. Replaces ad-hoc
  `mod10/mod100` switches that previously hard-coded Ukrainian plural rules.
- `StringResolver` interface (data layer): thin abstraction over
  `android.content.res.Resources` so repositories don't import Android types
  directly and JVM-only unit tests can supply a deterministic fake without
  Robolectric or mockito.
- Animated stickers (TGS / WebM / WEBP), animated emoji and custom-emoji
  reactions. Pipeline reuses TDLib's batched `GetCustomEmojiStickers` (up to
  200 ids per call, 50ms debounce) and serves the WEBP/PNG `Sticker.thumbnail`
  as an instant placeholder while the animation downloads. TGS playback is
  Lottie-Compose with a 32-entry LRU cache of parsed compositions and a 5 MB
  gunzip safety cap; WebM playback is ExoPlayer-backed, looped, muted and
  lifecycle-aware (pauses on `ON_PAUSE`, fully releases on dispose). Inline
  custom emojis in formatted text are wired through Compose `InlineTextContent`
  with `needsRepainting`-aware tint via Lottie's COLOR_FILTER dynamic property.
- "Сховище і трафік" section in Settings — surfaces TDLib's network usage and
  storage footprint with a one-tap "Clear cache" action.
- Twitter-style "новi пости" floating pill at the top of the feed: stacked
  channel avatars + count, tap to scroll-to-top and reveal new content. The
  visible feed is frozen on what the user has already seen until they
  explicitly accept (pill tap or pull-to-refresh).
- Process-wide TDLib lifecycle bridge (`TdLifecycleBridge`): toggles
  TDLib's `online` flag with foreground state and tracks the actual
  `NetworkType` via `ConnectivityManager`. Push-safe (does not force
  `NetworkTypeNone` on background).
- ProGuard / R8 keep rules for TDLib's JNI surface, `kotlinx.serialization`
  companions, Compose stability annotations, and coroutines metadata.

### Changed
- Comments overlay now opens instantly when reopened within 30 seconds.
  First-load anchor resolution is permanently cached for the session.
- Re-opening the app no longer triggers a full 200-channel TDLib refresh
  unless the cached feed is older than 60 seconds.
- Re-entering a channel filter within 60 seconds reuses the previous
  `GetChatHistory(80)` result instead of re-fetching.
- Coil memory cache lowered from 20% to 10% of Java heap — safer on
  low-end devices, leaves headroom for our state holders.
- TDLib log verbosity is now `error` on debug builds and `fatal` on
  release.

### Fixed
- `MediaCache` no longer logs noisy warnings when a Composable leaves
  composition mid-download (`LeftCompositionCancellationException`).
- Crash on `UpdateMessageInteractionInfo` events with a null payload —
  the new coalescing buffer correctly skips them instead of inserting
  null into a `ConcurrentHashMap`.

### Performance
- Discussion threads share one `WhileSubscribed` SharedFlow per anchor —
  reopening the comments overlay no longer re-runs `GetMessageProperties`
  + `GetMessageThread` + a full history load.
- Feed storage uses a `PersistentList` from `kotlinx.collections.immutable`
  — per-event mutations from `UpdateMessageInteractionInfo` are now
  O(log N) structural updates instead of O(N) array copies.
- `UpdateMessageInteractionInfo` events coalesce in a 200 ms window — one
  batched `_posts.update {}` per window rather than dozens of separate
  emits during news bursts.
- `UpdateFile` progress events throttle to 10 Hz per file — TDLib's 30+ Hz
  sub-pixel-progress emits no longer recompose every visible thumbnail.
- `MediaCache` no longer materialises a `MutableStateFlow` slot for every
  TDLib `UpdateFile` — slots are created only when a Composable observes a
  fileId. Long sessions used to leak slots proportional to TDLib's
  internal file table.

### Architecture
- Removed a four-coroutine race in `CommentsRepository.observeThread`
  where four `launchIn` collectors mutated a shared `MutableList` from
  concurrent dispatch threads. A single `td.updates.collect` inside the
  flow body replaces them.
- `PostContent` and the entire data class graph reachable from
  `TimelinePost` (`Reactions`, `ReactionItem`, `FormattedText`, `TdMedia`,
  `WebPreview`, etc.) carry `@Immutable` end-to-end so Compose's
  stability inference can skip recomposition for `PostCard` reliably.
- `ChannelsScreen` now uses `collectAsStateWithLifecycle`, matching the
  rest of the surfaces.
