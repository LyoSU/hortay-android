# Changelog

[Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com) · [SemVer](https://semver.org). One user-visible change per bullet; rationale lives in commits, not here.

## [Unreleased]

### Added
- Feed mode `OldestUnreadFirst` (Settings → Feed): read on top, unread below, lands at boundary.
- Snap-scroll mode (Settings → Feed).
- Per-chat read state with unread strip on card edge.
- Inline retry on failed guest-mode Channel rows.

### Changed
- Channels-row status folded into `@handle · <status>` subtitle (UK + EN).
- Channel-drill rendered as overlay above always-mounted Feed.

### Fixed
- Fresh posts reach `OldestUnreadFirst` feed without restart.
- Cold-start scroll-pin no longer fires on mid-session arrivals.
- Photo albums no longer ship with missing members on slow networks.

### Changed
- `ChannelScreen` extracted; `TimelineScreen` is feed-only.

### Fixed
